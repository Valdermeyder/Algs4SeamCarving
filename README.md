Algs4SeamCarving
================

Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height (or width) at a time. A vertical seam in an image is a path of pixels connected from the top to the bottom with one pixel in each row. (A horizontal seam is a path of pixels connected from the left to the right with one pixel in each column.) Below left is the original 505-by-287 pixel image; below right is the result after removing 150 vertical seams, resulting in a 30% narrower image. Unlike standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (e.g. cropping and scaling), the most interesting features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image are preserved.  As you'll soon see, the underlying algorithm is quite simple and elegant. Despite this fact, this technique was not discovered until 2007 by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir. It is now a feature in Adobe Photoshop (thanks to a Princeton graduate student), as well as other popular computer graphics applications.
